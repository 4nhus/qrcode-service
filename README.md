This is the QRCode Service from the Java Backend Developer Track provided by Jetbrains Academy. It uses the ZXing library to generate QR Codes from string content sent in HTTP requests. The API endpoint that generates QR codes accepts several HTTP request parameters to modify the image served:
- size, for the size of the QR code image
- correction, for the level of error resilience that the QR code has
- type, for the format of the QR code image served
